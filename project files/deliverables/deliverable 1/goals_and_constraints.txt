### Goals and Constraints ###
The project goals can be divided into two categories. The first consists of
mandatory goals which must be implemented in order to meet the minimum project
requirements. The second category includes goals which, while not absolutely necessary, would
enhance the quality of the project and set Mytinerary apart from other program planners.
These secondary goals were set by asking ourselves what features \emph{we} would look for
in a program planner. Additionally, a survey targeting Concordia software engineering
students was conducted to gauge interest in proposed features, including multilingual
support and integration with Rate-My-Professor. The data from this survey are
presented in Appendix A.

# Functional Requirements #
The following use cases summarize Mytinerary's functional requirements. Each
use case will deal with two possible actors: a student, who will use the
system to generate course schedules, and a program director, who can modify
course and section information.

Difficult and importance are scored on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 denoting
extremely high difficulty/importance.

# Domain Model #
Figure \ref{fig:domain_model} illustrates a domain model for our system. The principal domain objects are the student, the course section, and the scheduler itself. Students, who are users, have preferences and an academic record and interact with the scheduler. The scheduler in turn consults the student's academic record and preferences, the requirements of the program the student is enrolled in, and the available course sections offered in each semester to generate a list of tentative schedules for the student to select. Course sections consist possibly of a tutorial section and a lab and are in turn instances of the more general course object. Finally there are program directors, who are users of the system with the privilege to view and modify student academic records and manage course details.


# Constraints and Qualities #
Security
Security is an important requirement, the Mytinerary website shall ensure that data is protected. The datas are protected by unauthorized access by a hashing algorithm, called blowfish encryption algorithm. Input forms are proted by xss filtering. 

Speed

All pages within the website should be accessible in under one second? 

Usability 

The web application should be cross-platform compatible usable through various mobile,tablet OS such as android and iOS in addition to full desktop support?
